110707 IMPLEMENT DECODING/TRAINING LOOP (only local feats)
then execute exp and record new lower-boundary BLEU
OK!	method to Pop heap
OK! 	free memory policy
OK!	pop best
OK!	correct weight if wrong
OK!	update queue if wrong
	structure for borders
	update queue if correct

110705 MODIFY UCAND AND SCORING
OK! 	use models.AddFeaturesToUCand() to score
OK!	do not pass out_hg in AddFeaturesToUCand()
OK!	pass UCand in AddFeaturesToUCand()
OK!	move feature vectors from HG::Edge to UC
OK!	remove added field from HG::Edge forest feat vector
OK!	replace bottom up data structs for states j_ D with undir
OK!	do not use UCandidate.out_edge_ 
OK!  	remove UCand.j_ and D add pointer structure
